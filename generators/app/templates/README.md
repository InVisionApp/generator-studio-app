## Setting up your environment

To install all the required dependencies locally and begin development use:

```
npm install
```

## Building and developing your plugin

There are two scripts available that will bundle and install your plugin.

### Development Mode

```
npm run start
```

This will build and install your plugin in _development_ mode. Whenever you make changes to your source files, it will automatically rebuild and reinstall your plugin.

### Production Mode

```
npm run build
```

This builds and installs your plugin in _production_ mode. This bundle is minified to reduce file size. Changes made to your source will **NOT** be automatically rebuilt.
